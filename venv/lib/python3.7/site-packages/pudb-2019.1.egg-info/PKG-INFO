        PuDB is a full-screen, console-based visual debugger for Python.
        
        Its goal is to provide all the niceties of modern GUI-based debuggers in a
        more lightweight and keyboard-friendly package. PuDB allows you to debug code
        right where you write and test it--in a terminal. If you've worked with the
        excellent (but nowadays ancient) DOS-based Turbo Pascal or C tools, PuDB's UI
        might look familiar.
        
        Here's a screenshot:

        Features
        --------
        
        * Syntax-highlighted source, the stack, breakpoints and variables are all
          visible at once and continuously updated. This helps you be more aware of
          what's going on in your program. Variable displays can be expanded, collapsed
          and have various customization options.
        
        * Simple, keyboard-based navigation using single keystrokes makes debugging
          quick and easy. PuDB understands cursor-keys and Vi shortcuts for navigation.
          Other keys are inspired by the corresponding pdb commands.
        
        * Use search to find relevant source code, or use "m" to invoke the module
          browser that shows loaded modules, lets you load new ones and reload existing
          ones.
        
        * Breakpoints can be set just by pointing at a source line and hitting "b" and
          then edited visually in the breakpoints window.  Or hit "t" to run to the line
          under the cursor.
        
        * Drop to a Python shell in the current environment by pressing "!".
        
        * PuDB places special emphasis on exception handling. A post-mortem mode makes
          it easy to retrace a crashing program's last steps.
        
        * Ability to control the debugger from a separate terminal.
        
        * IPython integration (see `wiki <http://wiki.tiker.net/PuDB>`_)
        
        * Should work with Python 2.6 and newer, including Python 3.
